* Installed DrRacket with SICP support from http://www.neilvandyke.org/racket-sicp/
	* There is also MIT Scheme, but it people recommend nowadays DrRacket with
	  the Neil Van Dyke's SICP module
* To use SICP support just add `#lang planet neil/sicp` to the beginning of the file
* Learned that I can open the REPL from terminal with `neil/sicp` support(for
  more info http://crash.net.nz/) :

		racket  -i -p neil/sicp -l xrepl

  I liked this better because it let me use `readline`, so all bash (emacs)
  shortcuts (like jumping to the beginning) works. Don't know if DrRacket
  support it though.
